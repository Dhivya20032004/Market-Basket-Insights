# how to run
install jupyter notebook in your command prompt
# pip install jupyter lab
# pip install jupyter notebook(or)
           1.Download anaconda community software for desktop
           2.install anaconda community
           3.open jupyter notebook
           4.type the code & execute the given code


## Requirements

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended for data exploration)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- mlxtend (for association rule mining)

You can install the required Python packages using the following command:


bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn mlxtend


## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.


bash
git clone https://github.com/Dhivya20032004/market-basket-insights.git


2. Navigate to the project directory.


bash
cd market-basket-insights


3. Open your Jupyter Notebook or another Python IDE to run the code.

## Usage

Follow these steps to run the code:

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook provided in the project directory.

2. Load your market basket data into the notebook. You can use the sample dataset provided or replace it with your own data. Make sure your data is in a CSV format.

3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to:

    - Explore the data using `head()`, `tail()`, `info()`, and `describe()` to get a better understanding of the dataset.
    
    - Perform feature engineering and data preprocessing if needed.
    
    - Use association rule mining techniques to discover frequent itemsets and generate association rules.
    
    - Visualize and interpret the results to gain market basket insights.

4. Customize the parameters for association rule mining, such as support, confidence, and lift, to fine-tune your analysis based on your specific business needs.

## Data

The project uses a sample market basket dataset for demonstration purposes. You can replace this dataset with your own transaction data in CSV format. Ensure that your data has columns representing transactions and items, and it's properly formatted.

## Results

Results and insights derived from the analysis are displayed in the Jupyter Notebook. You can visualize and interpret the frequent itemsets and association rules to make informed decisions for your business.
ertainly! Here's an updated README file that includes the data source and a brief description of the market basket data for insights:

# Market Basket Insights

## Overview
This project aims to provide insights into market basket data using association rule mining techniques. By analyzing transaction data, we can discover which items are frequently purchased together, helping businesses understand customer behavior and improve their sales strategies.

## Data Source :  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aslanahmedov/market-basketanalysis
The dataset used for this project is sourced from a fictional retail store, and it represents customer transactions over a specific time period. The dataset contains the following columns:

- `Transaction ID`: A unique identifier for each transaction.
- `Product ID`: A unique identifier for each product.
- `Product Name`: The name of the product purchased.
- `Quantity`: The quantity of the product purchased in the transaction.

The data allows us to explore purchasing patterns and identify relationships between products, which can be used to provide valuable insights for the retail business.

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended for data exploration)
- Pandas
